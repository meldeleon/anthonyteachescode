- ubuntu does calendar versioning, they name releases based on date. 22.04 (2022, apr)
- unix was an early OS
    - BSD - democratized. very nice but aggressive, like rust users but nice.
    - linux - linus torvalds' love child (he fucked a super computer)
        - many distributions // archlinux (vegans), fedora(), ubuntu (deriv of debian).
        - all distributions share the same linux kernel .
    - ubuntu names all its releases a adjective and then an animal. ubuntu jammy jellyfish > ubuntu jammy // even numbered versions have long term support.
