## rm 
- remove command
- `-r` opt recursive, it descends into all arguments and deletes everything below it. 
- `-f` opt force
- `-i` interactive mode, will have you confirm each recursive deletion.
- `-I` interative mode, but will only have you confirm is there are >3 items in dir.
- interactive opt is not useful/won't do anything if not recursive or if deleting with wildcards/many things at one time.
