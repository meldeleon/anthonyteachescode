## Python background
- old language, python1 came out in 90s, python 2 is most popular version.
- python3 came out in 2008, was not widely adopted. drastically reworked the language, so backwards compatibility was difficult.- python2 end of lifed in 2020.
- designed the executable names to coexist at the same time, python was usually python2, while python3 was the executable for python3.
- PEP(python enhancement proposals) - process for proposing ideas in python.
- python3 is usually the default executable for python.
- REPL - read evalute print loop. the try shit terminal box.
- to run type `python file.py` or run a module `python -m file`
- -i will launch the REPL after running a file for interactive mode. 
- everything in python is an object, everything has a type, even the types have a type. in python3 types are classes.
- python has classical inheritance. has a lookup table of functions for each type in the inheritance hierarchy. 
- anthbonk strongly suggests against using inheritance.
- python is generally defined as a multi-paradigm language, you can write oo python or function python, anthbonk does procedural python with functional stuff.
- functional programming - no iteration, everything is basic input/output of function, map/filter/reduce all the things.
- `python -m pydocs searchterm` to look up python types/methods etc.
