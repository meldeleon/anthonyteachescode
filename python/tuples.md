## Tuples ##
- data type, container sequence of other things.
- syntax for empty tuple `()`, syntax for tuples otherwise is just a comma seperated list, the `(1,2)` do nothing, but are included conventionally.
- tuples are immutable, cannot be modified, but can be reassigned.
- one element tuple `(1,)` 
- tuples are iterable
- can construct a tuple from any other iterable using `tuple()` function
### methods ###
- adding tuples concatenates them
- contain returns boolean if an element is contained
- you can compare the values of two tuples with `==`
- greater than or lesser than does an element wise comparison until one runs out
  - this is compared similarly to how one organizes a dictionary.
  - you cannot compare types
- `len()` returns length of tuple
- `*` multiples the tuple by concating multiple copies of itself
- rmul vs mul -- right handedness vs left handedness `2 * tuple`
- `tuple.count()` counts the instance of a value in a tuple.
- `tuple.index()` returns the index of a value in a tuple. returns error if not in tuple.
- you can spread/splat tuples with `newple = (*tuple,)`. 
- unpacking/destructuring tuples, it is generally the opposite of spread/splat; takes the values of a tuple and assigns it to variables.
